Air Quality Prediction: Forecasting the Top 10 Most Polluted Cities in the Next 5 Years
Overview
This project leverages time series forecasting using the ARIMA model to predict air pollution levels across multiple cities. The goal is to identify the top 10 most polluted cities over the next 5 years based on PM2.5 concentrations. The dataset (combined.csv) contains historical pollution data, which is processed and analyzed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

By accurately forecasting future pollution trends, this project aims to provide valuable insights for policy makers, environmental researchers, and city planners to mitigate pollution and improve air quality.

Project Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Preprocessing
Load the dataset (combined.csv) and select relevant columns (datetime, cityid, and pollutant levels like PM2.5, PM10, etc.).

Convert the datetime column to a proper date format for time series analysis.

Handle missing values using mean imputation.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Aggregation
Convert timestamps to monthly periods (year_month) to perform monthly pollution trend analysis.

Group pollution data by city and month, computing average pollution levels per month for each city.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Data Variability
Cities with constant PM2.5 values are skipped, as ARIMA cannot process non-varying data.

Cities with less than 12 months of data are also ignored to ensure robust forecasting.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is applied to forecast pollution levels.

The model predicts pollution trends for each city over the next 5 years.

Error handling ensures that unstable models are skipped, preventing failures.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting the Top 10 Most Polluted Cities
Forecasted pollution levels are averaged over the predicted period.

The top 10 cities with the highest projected PM2.5 levels are identified and displayed.

Key Features

‚úîÔ∏è Robust ARIMA forecasting: Ensures meaningful predictions for time series data.
‚úîÔ∏è Dynamic error handling: Avoids processing failures due to poor-quality data.
‚úîÔ∏è Customizable framework: Can be extended for different pollutants or forecasting methods.

Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding air pollution trends and identifying high-risk cities for the next five years. The insights generated can aid in policy decisions, urban planning, and environmental research.

Future improvements could include:
üöÄ Incorporating external factors like weather, population growth, or traffic data.
üöÄ Using deep learning models (LSTMs, Prophet) for enhanced forecasting.
üöÄ Developing a web dashboard to visualize real-time pollution trends.

This project serves as a strong portfolio piece for data science and machine learning roles, demonstrating time series forecasting expertise in a meaningful real-world problem. üåé
